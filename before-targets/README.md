# before-targets folder description

This folder is for scripts that have not been integrated into the `targets()` workflow.

Scripts that are exploratory in nature and are not needed for the refinery analysis should be saved in the `exploratory` subfolder. These scripts will not be integrated into the `targets()` workflow.

Scripts that are needed to perform the analysis in our study should be saved in the `analysis` subfolder. Tracey and Meas will integrate finalized code into the targets format.
